#  Android/iOS folders files

The goal of this repository is to hold the different files that will be overwrited by $react-native eject (which will recreate android and ios folders). 

The location of the files listed in this directory are:
* android/app/build.gradle
* android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* ios/BitcoinBazaar/Info.plist

## Android signing
Keep in mind that replacing android/app/build.gradle will ask you to have set up the different signing files for android.
